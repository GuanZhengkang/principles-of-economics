## Computing

In homework, we will use the statistical computing language `R` to conduct some hands-on data analysis. See [here](../Software) for an introduction to `R`.

---

## Homework

We will use [Moodle](https://l.xmu.edu.cn/course/view.php?id=921) for course-related announcements and homework. Homework assignments should be prepared using the `markdown` language and rendered to either `html` or `pdf`. For assignments that involve data analysis, you should write your homework in `R markdown`, which allows you to include `R` codes and automatically generate their output.
