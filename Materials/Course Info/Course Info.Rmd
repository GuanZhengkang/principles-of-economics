# Homework

- Homework assignments are submitted on [Moodle](http://l.xmu.edu.cn).

- You are encouraged to discuss homework with your classmates, but must prepare yours *individually*.

- Economics is an empirical science. Even though this is an introductory course, we will be conducting some hands-on data analysis in our homework to help us apply and better understand the principles and theories we learn in class.

- We will be using a statistical computing language called `R`. See [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/principles-of-economics/Software/) for an introduction and helpful resources.

---

# Class Discussion

- We will be using [Piazza]( https://piazza.com/xmu.edu.cn/summer2019/poe) for course related discussions.

- If you any questions about the course materials and homework assignments, the best way to get answers is to ask them on Piazza.

    - Other students invariably have the same questions as you do and everyone can benefit from the discussions.
    
    - You can edit questions and answers wiki-style.
    
    - You can be anonymous if you wish.
    
    - You can also send private notes to the teaching staff.
    
- Active participation on Piazza will be considered towards the final grade.

# Recommended Readings

- In addition to classroom learning, it is important that you culitvate the habit of reading and following economic and financial news.

  - Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Financial Times (FT), Bloomberg, The Economist, ...
  
- For more engaged reading, I also recommend publications such as the Journal of Economic Perspectives, where economists publish non-technical articles on various topics in economics and finance.

- See [here](https://jiamingmao.github.io/principles-of-economics/Links) for a list of these and other recommended readings
