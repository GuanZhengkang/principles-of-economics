## Git and Github

The materials for this course are hosted on `Github` at [github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics](http://www.github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics). Since the course materials are continually updated throughout the semester, it is recommended that you clone this repo, and pull regularly to get updates. You can do this using `git` on the command line or using a GUI such as [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

[This tutorial](https://github.com/jiamingmao/principles-of-economics/blob/master/Materials/Software/Git%20Basics.md) walks you through the steps to do so. If you want to learn more about `git` and `Github`, here are some places to start:

- [A Guide to Git and Github](https://launchschool.com/books/git/)
- Cook, J., [Don't be afraid to commit](http://archaeogeek.github.io/foss4gukdontbeafraid/index.html)

## R

`R` is a programming language for statistical computing. Throughout the semester, we will be using `R` to conduct basic data analysis to help us apply and better understand the principles and theories we learn in class.

Here are some resources to help you start learning `R`:
- Michonneau, F., [The R Class](http://r-bio.github.io/)
- Phillips, N., [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)
- Kabacoff, R., [Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/)

To program in `R`, you need a text editor or an IDE. I recommend `RStudio`. You can download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/). `RStudio` is a powerful IDE and supports `Git` and `R markdown`. To learn how to use `RStudio` with `Github`, see:
- Bryan, J., [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/)

Once you have a basic command of `R`, I recommend you read this online book:
- Grolemund, G. and H. Wickham, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

## Markdown

`markdown` is a lightweight markup language for writing documents using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which can then be rendered into `html`, `pdf`, and other formats.

In this course, it is recommended that you write your homework and reports in `markdown` (See [why scholars should write in markdown](http://blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/files/2014/08/markdownpost-acmsmall.pdf)).
- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

There are many editors you can use to write in `markdown`. For example, you can try the online editor [editor.md](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html), or use a general purpose editor such as [atom](https://atom.io/).

Or you can use `RStudio`. `RStudio` allows you to write in `R markdown` -- a variant of the `markdown` language that allows you to include `R` codes and automatically generate their output. See:
- [The official R Markdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- Xie et al., [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
- Xie et al., [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)

## LaTeX

`LaTeX` is a markup language for writing technical and scientific documents and is widely used by the scientific community. Using `LaTeX`, you can easily input mathematics, create tables, graphs, and bibliographies, and make professional-looking presentations. 

If you are new to `LaTeX`, I recommend you start with the WYSIWYM (*what you see is what you mean*) editor [lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) or use the online collaborative editor [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
